## Camera control

When finger is not above any UI:

- Drag on the screen to rotate camera.
- Pinch in/out to zoom.
- Drag with 2 fingers to pan.

## H-scene Control

The following gestures work when you touch the H-scene control pad in the downright corner.

When not in auto mode:

- Tap to increase speed (same as vanilla game).

When in auto mode:

- Drag _vertically_ to change speed.

In either modes:

- Double tap to toggle auto mode.
- Drag _horizontally_ to one side to toggle alt motion.
- (Not recommended) Hold down one finger and tap the other on the pad to toggle alt motion. 
  (Basically a two-finger tap, but due to some constraints it may not
  work if you tap the finger in the reverse sequence)
